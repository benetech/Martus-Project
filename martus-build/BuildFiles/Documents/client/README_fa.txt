-	ساحات پائین شونده ناشی از اطلاعات (لِست های پائین شونده بوسیله اطلاعات 
  وارد شده در یک مشبک رویداد خبری ایجاد گردید) به لِست ساحات موجود جهت 
  جستجو در صفحه نمایش جستجو اضافه گردید.
-	پویش و بارگذاری قیمت های وارد شده در ساحات رویداد خبری در خانه خالی 
  "جستجو برای..." برای متن و انواعِ ساحه پائین شونده ناشی از اطلاعات در 
  صفحه نمایش جستجو اضافه گردید. هنگام چیدن ساحات متن جهت جستجو در صفحه 
  نمایش انتخاب ساحه، کاربران در صورت میل می توانند قوطی مارک دار 
  "بارگذاری همه قیمت های محتمل برای ساحه انتخاب شده" را انتخاب نمایند تا 
  قوطی "جستجو برای..." با قیمت هایی که در همه رویدادهای خبری در کمپیوتر 
  محلی وارد گردیده اند، خانه پُری شود. برای پائین شونده های-ناشی از 
  اطلاعات، قیمت ها هنگام انتخاب ساحه در صفحه نمایش، بطور اتومات در 
  رویدادهای خبری بارگذاری می گردند. اگر کاربران خواسته باشند، بدون رفتن 
  به صفحه نمایش انتخاب ساحه، جهت بارگذاری قیمت های ساحه یک دکمه 
  "بارگذاری همه قیمت های محتمل برای ساحه انتخاب شده" در جستجوی اصلی صفحه 
  نمایش نیز موجود می باشد (بطور مثال، پس از بارگذاری جستجوی ثبت شده 
  قبلی، و یا در صورتیکه آنها قوطی مارک دار را در ساحه انتخاب صفحه نمایش 
  انتخاب نکرده باشند). قیمت های بارگذاری شده به ترتیب الفبا، نه به 
  ترتیبی که در مشبک منبع اطلاعات وارد گردیده بودند، تنظیم می شوند. 
-	قیمت های پائین شونده های ناشی از اطلاعات، هنگام تصحیح رویدادهای خبری 
  با هدف ورود اطلاعات به آسانی، که بعوض تنظیم به ترتیب ورودشان در مشبک 
  منبع اطلاعات به ترتیب الفبا تنظیم تنظیم می شوند، تغیر یافته است.
-	حساب های مقرهای فرماندهی می توانند بدون محو نسخه های قبلی، ساحه تازه 
  کاری شده رویدادهای خبری مسوده را حصول مجدد نمایند.
-	جایی که Martus شرایط جستجوی قبلی تان را که حاوی ساحه "آخرین تاریخ 
  ثبت شده" است به یاد نداشته باشد، خطای آن درست شده است
-	خطای توضیح شده به کاربر در صورتیکه مقرهای فرماندهی سعی نماید تا 
  رویدادهای خبری ایجاد شده بوسیله یک حساب میزی را قفل نماید. یک حساب 
  مقرهای فرماندهی بخودی خود نمی تواند مستقیماً ساحه مسوده رویدادهای خبری 
  حاصل شده (انفرادی یا مجموعی) را قفل کند، اما می تواند ساحه مسوده 
  رویدادهای خبری حاصل شده را تغیر داده، مالک آن مسوده ها شده و سپس آنها 
  را قفل کند.
-	خطایی که هنگام چاپ و فرستادن هر کدام از قطعات عامه رویدادهای خبری به 
  ماشین جستجوی Martus، اطلاعات را از ستون های پائین شونده قابل استفاده 
  مکرر در داخل یک مشبک حذف می کرد، برداشته شده است.
-	ترجمه دری برای نمای کاربر  تازه کاری شده و گزینه های ترجیحی تقویم شمسی 
  افغانی اضافه گردیده است.
-	نمایش ترمیم شده ساحات پائین شونده قابل استفاده مکرر برای لسان های 
  راست به چپ، از طرف راست
-	ترمیم چندین خطاهای کوچک، توضیحات، و پاک کاری صفحات نمایش کاربر.



Version 3.5.1             2010-11   

- Fixed an issue with reusable choices dropdown lists where values 
  with overlapping labels were not distinguished during data entry.
- The search screen now sorts dropdown entries alphabetically, so 
  that if multiple customizations had the same field with different 
  dropdown values, the combined lists will be sorted, instead of new 
  values appearing at the bottom of the previous list.
- Fixed an issue where modifying a bulletin was not detecting if a 
  reusable choice dropdown list had been altered. Martus now correctly 
  asks if you want to use the old or new values. 
- Fixed an issue that would reset entries to previous value when 
  appending rows to grids with dropdowns in expanded view.


Version 3.5.0             2010-10

- Added a new customization feature that allows multi-level 
  dropdown lists, so that the user can define lower level values 
  that are dependent on the higher level value (e.g. for locations, 
  you can define state and city values where only cities that belong 
  to a particular state are displayed once the state value is selected).  
  The lists of choices you create for these dropdown fields are 
  "reusable" so they do not have to be typed more than once in your 
  customization definition.
- Allowed setting of default values for dropdown and text fields for 
  more efficient data entry.
- Fixed issue where data entered in a grid cell would not be saved if 
  you did not tab out of the cell or hit enter to create a new row in 
  the grid.
- Fixed issue where certain fields could show up more than once in 
  search and report field selection lists.  
- Added instructions for Bengali/Bangla, Burmese, and Khmer font 
  display in Martus to the User Guide.


Version 3.4.1             2010-08

- Changed the Martus time-out length when there is no activity to 
  be more flexible, instead of always timing out at 10 minutes. This 
  can help improve security if you are working in a public place or 
  on a shared computer, and can also improve the performance of 
  long operations (such as retrieval of bulletins from the server).  
  Different time-out lengths are allowed by setting a parameter in 
  the command line used to run Martus.  The parameter is 
  "--timeout-minutes=X" where X can be any number of minutes.  
  For example, to set the timeout length for Martus running on your 
  computer in Windows to always be 5 minutes for a higher level of 
  security, change the command line in the desktop shortcut (right-click, 
  and choose Properties) to the following: 
C:\Martus\bin\java.exe -Xbootclasspath/p:C:\Martus\lib\ext\bc-jce.jar -jar C:\Martus\martus.jar --timeout-minutes=5
  For instructions on how to change the Martus command line for Mac or Linux, 
  see section 2a of the User Guide or email info@martus.org.
- Fixed an issue with very large customizations that would cause Martus to 
  load very slowly and result in various errors.


Version 3.4.0             2010-03

- Added the ability to require data entry in certain grid 
  columns before a bulletin can be saved. 
- Added the ability to specify that all grid column specifications 
  in the Search screen be matched to a single row of bulletin grid 
  data. To do this, check the 'Match grid column specifications' 
  checkbox in the Search screen.  For example, if you want to search 
  for a specific victim name in a single row in your bulletins created 
  after a certain date, select the checkbox and enter the following 
  fields in the Search screen: "Victim Information: First Name" = x 
  and "Victim Information: Last Name" = y and "Date Created" >= YYYY-Mon-DD. 
  If you do not select the "Match grid column specifications" checkbox, 
  Martus will find bulletins created after your specified date where any 
  row has the first name you specified and any other row has the last 
  name specified, but not necessarily in the same bulletin row (you could 
  have a row with "First Name" = x and "Last Name" = b, and a different 
  row with "First Name" = a and "Last Name" = y, and Martus will find that 
  bulletin as matching the search because you did not specify that it had 
  to match in a single row).
- Added the ability to require that Martus validate all dates against 
  user-specified date ranges in the bulletin customization  (E.g. event 
  dates cannot be before or after a certain date, including the ability 
  to say that dates cannot be after “today”, i.e. in the future). 
  Please note that you can require date validation of standard 
  fields as well as custom fields. Date field Year dropdown choices 
  will reflect the hard-coded date ranges specified in the customization.
- Added ability to capture 'Extended bulletin history' across users. This 
  is viewable under the Bulletin Details button, so that a Headquarters 
  account who creates a new version of the bulletin can see the public 
  code and bulletin id of the previous author’s versions of the bulletins. 
  The previous author and bulletin identification information is also added 
  to the XML export of any bulletins with this extended history.
- Fixed Modify existing bulletin functionality so that Martus recognizes 
  whether the always Private section customization has changed, and asks 
  the user if they want to use the old or the new fields. 
- Added a warning message if a user tries to import an incompatible xml 
  file created by a different version of Martus.
- Several minor bug fixes, clarifications and clean-ups to the user screens.
- Updated version of English User Guide 


Version 3.3.2             2009-08

- Fixed issues related to expanded grids that contain data-driven-
  dropdowns, such as user interface slowness or freezing when tabbing 
  out of a field in an expanded grid that is a data-driven-dropdown
  source (and the data-driven-dropdown is also in an expanded grid), 
  collapsing a grid that contains a data-driven-dropdown, or saving 
  a bulletin with an expanded grid that contains a data-driven-dropdown. 
- Fixed incorrect functionality of custom multiline fields not 
  being displayed when creating page reports. Please note that
  page reports created with earlier versions of Martus will still 
  have the problem - users will have to create new page reports to 
  see the fix.


Version 3.3.0             2008-08

- Added the ability to 'batch' seal multiple drafts at once. To 
  do this, go to Edit > Seal bulletin(s).
- New feature to add a Headquarters to a group of bulletins or 
  to a an entire folder of bulletins at once. To do this, go to 
  Edit > Update headquarters access. This option will be grayed 
  out unless at least one bulletin is selected and at least one 
  HQ is configured. Martus will display a progress bar during the 
  update and allow you to cancel if desired. Draft bulletins will 
  be updated to reflect the new HQ information. For sealed 
  bulletins, Martus will automatically generate a new sealed 
  version of each bulletin.
- Added the ability to view several types of image attachments 
  inside Martus while previewing, creating, and editing bulletins, 
  as well as in the Bulletin Details preview.
- Several minor bug fixes, clarifications and clean-ups to 
  the user screens.


Version 3.2.0             2007-09

- New bulletin display functionality allows you to:  1) hide/unhide 
  fields in bulletins for long fields that take up a lot of space, 
  2) create sections in your bulletins which you can also 
  hide/unhide, 3) display grids in an "expanded" view (including 
  the ability to add rows from that view), 4) put fields next to 
  each other on a row, 5) reduce the default size of grids to save 
  space.
- Added the ability to require certain fields to be entered before 
  a bulletin can be saved. 
- Introduced the ability to create "data-driven" dropdowns, where 
  the values in a dropdown field are based on data that has been 
  entered in a grid field elsewhere in the bulletin.  Please note
  that the data source and resulting dropdown cannot be in the 
  same grid field.
- Added a Search progress status dialog, and the ability to cancel 
  Searches.
- Improved performance for Searches and other bulletin operations, 
  especially for users with large numbers of bulletins. 
- Fixed several issues, including:  1) configuration settings (e.g. 
  HQs) would not be saved for users with very large bulletin 
  customizations, 2) errors when dragging bulletins while sending 
  to/retrieving from a server.
- Improved messages to users (e.g. customization errors)
- Several minor bug fixes, clarifications and clean-ups to 
  the user screens.


Version 3.1.0             2007-04

- New functionality notifies HQs if there are field bulletins 
  to retrieve. To enable this in your Martus account, go to 
  Options > Preferences, and select "Automatically check for new 
  Field Desk bulletins." Approximately hourly, a message will 
  appear in the status bar (lower left corner of the screen) 
  saying that Martus is checking for new field desk bulletins. 
  The status bar will display another message if there are field 
  bulletins to be retrieved, at which point you can go to the 
  Server menu to load the Retrieve screen.  
- Added the ability to sort bulletins in the Retrieve screen 
  by clicking on the column headers. The sort functionality is 
  ascending only.
- Improved performance and possible memory issues during login 
  and exiting Martus for users with large numbers of bulletins. 
- Added a mechanism to speed up Martus loading and navigation 
  when an account has a large number of bulletins.  You can add 
  " --folders-unsorted" to the end of the command in your Martus 
  Desktop shortcut.  This will cause folders in Martus to be 
  unsorted when you initially load them (since sorting can take 
  time with a lot of bulletins.)  You can always click on a column 
  header in the bulletin preview list to sort the folder if desired, 
  but including this option will save time on startup and on 
  entering new folders in Martus.
- Fixed the following bugs introduced in version 3.0, including: 
  1) Date range fields not showing up on page reports, 
  2) Private section customization being lost when exiting 
  Martus, 3) Issues selecting files on a Mac (e.g. while 
  configuring HQs, attaching files to bulletins, restoring key, 
  and importing customization template,) 4) Inconsistent Arabic 
  date display in reports between bulletin details and summary 
  counts. 
- Several minor bug fixes, clarifications and clean-ups to 
  the user screens.


Version 3.0.0             2006-09

- Added report functionality.  Reports display results for 
  bulletins that match a certain search criteria, and can 
  be printed or saved to a file.  Reports can contain subsets 
  of bulletin fields, and can be formatted as a table with 
  one row for each bulletin.  Reports can be grouped and 
  sorted by several fields, with a summary count of bulletins 
  in each grouping.
- Added the ability to customize the format of the bottom/Private 
  section of bulletins.
- New Import functionality allows users to import electronic 
  data into Martus bulletin format, including both text and 
  attachment files. Export functionality was also updated to 
  match the Import structure, and now allows exporting of 
  attachments.
- Enhancements to Search functionality include the ability to
  search on particular columns within a customized grid, merging 
  similar fields in the field-selection-list, and clarifications 
  if multiple fields have the same labels.
- Changed default year in bulletin dates to be "Unknown", 
  instead of the current year
- Significant performance enhancements for accounts with 
  large numbers of bulletins, and specifically to loading of the
  Retrieve screen. Additional status messages to users during 
  potentially long operations.
- Customization enhancements, including additional messages 
  to users, and displaying long custom field labels on 
  multiple lines


Version 2.9.0             2006-03

- As of 2.6 Server release (March 2006), sped up several 
  major client/server operations.  Specifically, the following 
  operations are now faster: uploading/sending bulletins, 
  retrieving your own bulletins or field office bulletins, 
  initialization when connecting to the server at account login.
- Performance improvements for accounts with a large number of 
  bulletins.  Impacts the speed of the following actions:  
  display of folders/sorting/moving bulletins etc
- Changed Retrieve operations so that they happen in the 
  background (similar to sending bulletins to a server), so that 
  you can continue to work in Martus while that is happening 
  without waiting for the retrieval to finish.  When it is 
  complete, bulletins are displayed in the appropriate 
  "Retrieved" folder.  To cancel a Retrieve, go back into the 
  Retrieve dialog.
- Improved messages to the user about server status.
- Added the ability to search on columns within a grid (instead 
  of the entire text of the grid) when specifying field in an 
  Advanced Search, and added the option to search only on the 
  most recent version of bulletins.
- Fixed search bugs introduced in 2.8 and 2.8.1.  Specifically, 
  addressed incorrect search results on dropdown fields with 
  spaces in the choice values, and incorporated the 
  customization tags in the search field list where labels were 
  left blank (e.g. for section headers) so that there are no 
  empty values in the field list. 
- Added ability to insert and delete rows in customized grids 
  and search screen
- Use all available screen space when displaying bulletin data 
  and the Contact info dialog.
- Moved "Resend Bulletins" to be under the Server menu (for HQs 
  that back up bulletins to servers for field offices that do not 
  have access to the internet)
- Removed misleading "not all bulletins were retrieved" 
  messages that appeared when a HQ account did not have 
  permission to view old versions of certain bulletins
- Several updates to date preferences:  localization of date 
  formats, additional format choices, changes to correctly 
  display (and convert previously entered) Thai and Persian 
  dates.  Persian dates use a well-known arithmetic algorithm 
  for calculating leap years.  Also created tool to help diagnose 
  date settings.  
- Made change to help word processing programs correctly 
  display accents in html report files.
- Added Kurdish to the language dropdown list.  If you need 
  help with the display of Kurdish fonts in Martus, please 
  contact help@martus.org .
- Initial implementation of data import tool to allow 
  conversion of electronic text files (in .csv or .xml format) 
  to Martus bulletin format.  This initial version does not 
  handle import of customized grids or attachments, but will 
  handle all other field types.  For instructions/help on 
  running this utility, please contact help@martus.org .
- Numerous minor bug fixes, clarifications and clean-ups to 
  the user screens.


Version 2.8.1             2005-11

- Fixed a problem introduced in version 2.8 where dates and 
  date ranges with values earlier than January 1st 1970 were

- Removed incomplete/inaccurate Nepali 2.0.1 software user 
  interface translation, and placed an updated Nepali language 
  pack on http://www.martus.org/downloads.   This language pack 
  includes Nepali translations of the software user interface 
  (usable for versions 2.5 and later, with 90% of the strings 
  translated into Nepali), in-program help (version 2.0.1), 
  Quick Start Guide (version 2.0.1), User Guide (version 2.0.1),

In Windows, to run Martus in Nepali for version 2.7.2 and earlier 
so that all the menus will show up correctly, you must make a minor 
modification to the command used to start Martus (from the command 
prompt, and in any desktop/Start Menu shortcuts or aliases that were 
created when you installed).  

To run from the command line, go to your Martus directory and type:

  templates to give to field users, or users to export their own 
  templates.  Users can then import customization settings from a

  that changes or additions can be made to previously sealed 
  bulletins.  In this release of Martus you will only be able 
  to search and view the full contents of the most current 
  version (you will be able to view the title/bulletin-id/
  saved-date of any previous versions that are stored on your 
  computer, by clicking on the Bulletin Details button).  
- Added ability to install new and updated translations at 
  any time following a full Martus release.  A Language pack

- Numerous minor bug fixes, clarifications and clean-ups to the 
  user screens.
- There may be issues with the display of some screens in the 
  Martus 2.5 installation program when using the Nepali or Thai 
  language.  Because it is difficult to test this on all versions

  two menu items:  "Delete My Data" which removes this account's 
  bulletins and key pair; and "Delete All Data and Remove Martus" 
  which uninstalls Martus and removes the entire Martus directory 
  including other accounts' data  this is meant to only be used 
  in emergency cases
- Enhanced key backup functionality - you do not have to do a 
  backup before you have created any bulletins, but are reminded 
  to backup your key at a later point if you have not done so.

  changes the login screen in several ways:  You have a choice 
  between signing in to an already setup account, creating a 
  new account, or restoring from a key pair backup.  There will 
  be a sub-directory for each account under the Martus directory.
- The ability to select the language in which you want to run 
  Martus is now available on the signin screen.
- Improved key pair backup functionality, and the ability to back 
  up into multiple "secret share" files to be distributed to friends.  
- Extended Quick Erase functionality to allow removal of key pair, 
  scrubbing of bulletin and key pair data before deletion, and the 
  ability to complete the Quick Erase operation and exit Martus 
  without user-interaction/prompting.
- A new Tools Menu (for Quick Erase, key pair, and HeadQuarters 
  actions)
- Improved communication with Martus backup servers, and clearer 
  messages to user about server status
- Additional language options added to bulletin selection list
- A bug was fixed that prevented previous versions of the Martus 
  program from successfully retrieving bulletins from a backup 
  server if the bulletins contained public information with 
  non-English letters.  This bug did not affect the ability for 
  bulletins to be securely backed up to a Martus server.  The 
  problem would only be noticed if the bulletins were not present 
  on your machine, and you tried to retrieve your own or your 
  field office sealed bulletins containing non-English language 
  public data (the message received in this case was "Errors 
  occurred while retrieving bulletin summaries.  Some of the 
  bulletins on the server will not be shown.")  The bug did not 
  affect the retrieval of all-private or draft bulletins.  You 
  must also be accessing a production Martus backup server, or 
  upgrade your own server to run Martus Server Software version 
  2.0 or later, to be able to retrieve bulletins with non-English 
  language public data.
- Update to Java version to 1.4.2_03
- Numerous minor bug fixes, clarifications and clean-ups to the 
  user interface.


Version 1.2.1             2003-12

- Russian version introduced, including special version of 
  Russian install program.
- English and Spanish User Guides updated with 1.2 functionality
- LinuxJavaInstall.txt script created to simplify Java 
  installation on GNU/Linux machines.


Version 1.2.0             2003-09

- You can now customize the fields of all subsequently created 
  bulletins.  Customizing fields is currently only intended to 
  be used by "advanced" users.  When you choose that menu option, 
  you are warned about this, and told that if you don't know what 
  you're doing, you should turn back or risk messing up your 
  system.  When you do get there, you're provided with a list
  of the existing standard field tags, separated by semi-colons.  
  You can remove any of those, except for four "required" fields: 
  entrydate, language, author, and title.  You can change the 
  sequence.  You can also insert your own new custom fields.  
  Each custom field must have a "tag", which is a string of 
  lower-case ASCII letters, followed by a comma, followed by the 
  prompt that will be shown on screen, which can contain mixed 
  case letters and spaces.  If you try to save a custom field
  definition string that violates any of the rules, you'll be 
  told that it is invalid, but you currently are given no 
  indication of which rule you have broken.
- You now have the option of entering a date range (a time 
  period between two dates), for the bulletin event date.
- Russian UI added, with over 90% of the messages translated 
  into Russian.
- You can now specify an entire folder for export.
- If the normal Martus ports are not available for 
  communication with a backup server because of problems such 
  as firewall configuration issues, the Martus program falls 
  back to using ports 80/443.
- The usability of the keypair backup process has been improved.
- CD image and full download include a newer version of Java, 
  v 1.4.1_03.
- Numerous minor bug fixes, clarifications and clean-ups to the 
  user interface, including more support for mouseless operation.


Version 1.0.3             2003-05

- Release Linux and Mac compatible Martus versions.
- If you have installed a previous version of Martus software, 
  you can download a smaller version of Martus software 
  without having to download the full, larger file containing 
  all of Java.
- Bulletins may be exported from the program in an XML text 
  format.
- Check for compatible Java version during installation and 
  startup.
- Improve speed of manipulating bulletins with attachments.
- Change to busy-cursor during time consuming operations.
- You can now view attachments when running in Windows.
- Changes to the GNU GPL compatible license agreement, relaxing 
  user-notification requirements when borrowing code for uses 
  unrelated to Martus software, and extending coverage to 
  Martus server applications.
- You are now able to receive messages from a Martus server, 
  including a server compliance statement.
- There's a new Welcome dialog that appears when you start 
  the program, indicating whether this is an official version 
  of the program.
- Simplify Martus software installation when downloading the 
  install program. The Jar verification program is now available 
  as a separate download.
- A new Quick Erase feature will delete all local copies of 
  bulletins from your hard drive.
- Fixed a bug where a bulletin could become corrupted if you 
  retrieved it from a server and then modified a copy of it by 
  adding a new attachment.
- Updated some Spanish translation strings.
- Fixed a problem with the window needing the current focus 
  when the user times out.
- Force the signin dialog to be the top window, and add it to 
  the task bar.
- Hide main window during editing.
- Include an updated crypto library, and a new version of Java, 
  v 1.4.1_02, that supports entry of foreign characters using 
  the numeric keypad and fixes a memory leak that gradually 
  depletes available memory.
- Add standard Windows hot keys in obvious places, such as del, 
  and control- C, X, V, and A.


Version 1.0.2             2003-02

- When you choose to modify a sealed bulletin it makes a copy 
  of the bulletin, but if the original had attachments, the 
  system could become confused and end up damaging the copy, 
  the original, or both. This has been fixed.
- Allow CD distribution of default contents that can pre-
  populate the Details field of every bulletin.  If 
  DefaultDetails.txt is on the CD it will be copied to the 
  Martus directory upon installation.  Then, if 
  DefaultDetails.txt is found in the Martus directory when 
  a new account is created, it will give the user the 
  opportunity to use this as their default Details contents 
  for any bulletins they create.
- Reorganize code and internal package structure for easier
  maintainability.


Version 1.0.1             2003-01

- Ask during program installation if the user wants the Martus
  program, the Martus uninstall, and the documentation files 
  added to the Windows Start menu.
- Update from Java Runtime Environment version 1.4.1 to 
  version 1.4.1_01, gaining minor Java security improvements.
- Make sure all required third party sources, third party 
  runtime licenses, documentation files, and Winsock programs 
  for Windows 95, are copied to the hard drive during 
  installation.
- Correct errors in the About Box and the documentation's 
  copyright notice.

Special instructions for updating Winsock if you have 
   problems running Martus software on Windows 95:

Java requires the Microsoft Winsock 2.0 library.  It is 
extremely likely that your system already has Winsock 2.0 or 
later.  However, it is possible that some Microsoft Windows 95 
systems have an older version of Winsock.

To check which version of Winsock you have, search for 
"winsock.dll".  Then choose "Properties" from the File menu 
and click the Version tab.

If your Microsoft Windows 95 machine doesn't have Winsock 2.0 
or later, you can run the Winsock 2.0 installation program 
located in the Martus\Win95 directory.


If you are curious, the following URL contains information 
about how to determine if the Winsock 2.0 components are 
installed on a Microsoft Windows 95 platform:
