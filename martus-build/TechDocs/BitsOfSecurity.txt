Formual to calculate bits of security

Log2(6) * 40 = 90

- Instead of hashing the original value as intended, we convert it
to base64, and hash that. If true (please double check source),  that would
mean that every 8 bits only contain 6 bits of actual data, so 120 * 6 /
8 = 90 bits.

- 90 bits isn't terrible.
