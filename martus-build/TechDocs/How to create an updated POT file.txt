1. Run the ExportTranslationFile java class, passing 'en' as the language,
and specifying a path to output an English mtf file. here are the arguments 
I pass when running it from inside eclipse:
  en /home/kevins/Downloads/temp/Martus-en.mtf

2. Run the mtf2po utility. On my computer, from the directory containing 
the English mtf file, I run:
  ruby /home/kevins/work/hg/martus/martus/martus-build/mtf2po.rb
  
Running mtf2po will generate a .pot file, and will also create a .po file 
for each non-English .mtf file in the current directory.
