Steps to clean the HRDAG "Jenkins" Server and get back needed disk space
since all releases and internal releases are always stored here and only
manual deleting of unneeded releases is necessary until we automate the process.
This cleanup of the server hard drive is needed because without it the
hard drive will fill up and the builds will fail.

In addition to moving public full releases, any alpha or beta
releases that went outside the Martus team should be archived as well.
For example if we sent something to the Burmese folks for testing, or to
the Internews folks to prepare training materials.

1. Get Scott to give you permission to SSH into hrdag.benetech.org as
the jenkins user.  He will use your existing public key to allow you to
log in without entering a password.  Currently our home directory is /dev/hdc3,
but Scott could change this at any time.


2. From a Terminal 
	2A) ssh jenkins@hrdag.benetech.org
	
	2B) Now move all releases or public alpha/beta's out to the archive directory
	If you don't know the specific Build # you could figure this out by:
	ls MartusClient-5*
	This will give you a list of all Client Releases starting with 5 
	(i.e.: 5.0.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2, etc...)
	From there you will get the build # and install build #
	(i.e.: MartusClient-5.0.0-3482-400.dmg, MartusClient-5.0.1-3485-402.dmg, etc..)
	So the Build Number's here would be 3482, and 3485.
	
	2C) Now that you have the build # you can list all associated files with that build
	(i.e.: ls *-3482-*)
	Now move this release to 'archive'
	mv *-3482-* archive/
	
	2D) You should also move the .jar and .zip files associated with this release
	(i.e.: ls *-3482.*)
	Now move this to 'archive'
	mv *-3482.* archive/
	
	2E) We can skip moving the NSIS zip files and just delete them
	Eg: martus-client-nsis-zip-5.0.0.zip
	
	2F) Repeat this for all Releases if there have been multiple prior to the cleanup.
	
	2G) Next we must delete the old unneeded releases.  To do this first pick a date you 
	wish to delete all older files. (I used 'ls -lt')
	
	Then you can use either 'rm *-####-*' and 'rm *-####.*' for each build you want to delete
	(make sure you first use 'ls *-####-*' to make sure you are deleting what you think)
	Alternatively you can also delete entire old Martus Build #'s
	Eg: rm *5.0.0* (again make sure you have archived the releases first!)
	The other option would be to delete a subset of builds again test with ls first
	Eg ls/rm *-###?-* (i.e.ls *-345?-* which would list/delete all builds 3450 through 3459)
	
	
	2G) To see how much space is available you can use the command 'df'
	You could do this before and after the deletes to see how much space has been recovered.
	(Currently our home directory is /dev/hdc3)

jenkins@hrdag ~ $ df
/dev/hda3              5036316   1645108   3135376  35% /
/dev/hda1               147764     17858    122277  13% /boot

Which you can see is 90% full.  (This was after cleaning up the directory)
