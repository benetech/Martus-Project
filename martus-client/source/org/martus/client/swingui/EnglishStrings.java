"field:CreateCustomFieldsHelp1=The layout of the records is dictated by an XML document.  " +
	"The document must begin with <CustomFields> and end with </CustomFields>. " +
	"By default the standard record fields occur at the top of the Custom Field declaration, " +
	"but they can be moved if desired.  However, there are four required fields that cannot be removed:  " +
	"'author', 'entrydate', 'language' and 'title'.\n\n",
"field:CreateCustomFieldsHelp2=For custom (non-standard) fields, " +
	"you first select the type of field you want.  " +
	"The possible choices are 'BOOLEAN', 'DATE', 'DATERANGE', 'DROPDOWN', " +
	"'GRID', 'LANGUAGE', 'MESSAGE', 'MULTILINE', 'STRING', and 'SECTION'. " +
	"\n\n" +
	"For each custom field you will need a unique identification tag.  " +
	"This tag can be any word except those already used by the system " +
	"(eg. 'author', 'summary', 'location', 'title' etc.), " +
	"and cannot contain spaces or special characters.  " +
	"Examples of choices are 'VictimsName', 'EyeColorChoice', etc." +
	"\n\n" +
	"Then you need a label which is displayed next to your custom field.  " +
	"An example might be 'Name of 1st Witness'." +
	"\n\n" +
	"You can create sections (which you can hide/unhide) in your records " +
	"using a SECTION field type.  " +
	"\n\n" +
	"You can put multiple fields on a single row in your record by using " +
	"<KeepWithPrevious/> in the field definition." +
	"\n\n" +
	"You can require certain fields or grid columns to be entered before " +
	"saving a record by using </RequiredField> in the field definition." +
	"\n\n" +
	"You can restrict standard or custom date fields, date grid columns, date range fields, " +
	"and date range grid columns by using <MinimumDate> and/or <MaximumDate> " +
	"tags with a date in YYYY-MM-DD format. " +
	"Note: The year must always be a 'Gregorian' year like 2009, " +
	"even if Martus is configured to use Thai or Afghan or Persian dates. " +
	"A blank date, shown as <MaximumDate/>, means 'today', " +
	"although it may allow one day earlier or later, " +
	"due to time zone issues. " +
	"\n\n" +
	"You can populate drop-down lists (either inside or outside of a grid) " +
	"in three ways - " +
	"1) by entering a list of <Choices> values in the field definition, " +
	"2) with values that have been entered in a grid elsewhere " +
	"in your record by using <DataSource> (sometimes called \"data-driven dropdowns\"), and " +
	"3) by creating a list of \"Reusable Choices\" that can be referred to " +
	"by more than one field.  " +
	"See examples below for the correct XML definition syntax to use." +
	"\n\n" +
	"You can set a default value for text and dropdown list fields by using " +
	"<DefaultValue>ddd</DefaultValue>. " +
	"For dropdowns, you must use a value already in the list of choices you defined. " +
	"For Reusable Choices dropdowns it can be a partial or complete code, with each level separated by dots " +
	"(for a location dropdown that has both Region and City levels, " +
	"you could pick the default to be at either level, e.g. either R1 or R1.C1, see example below). " +
	"Default values can be set for both standard and custom fields, " +
	"but are NOT allowed for BOOLEAN, DATE, DATERANGE, GRID, LANGUAGE, MESSAGE, and SECTION field types, " +
	"and are not allowed for dropdowns where the values in the list are based on data entered in another field." +
	"(i.e. data-driven dropdowns).  " +
	"Please note that default values are only applied when a new record is created, " +
	"not when a new version of a record is created, " +
	"so that the value of the field in the previous version is not overwritten.  " +
	"This means that default values entered in a record using an earlier customization will be kept " +
	"even if you create a new version of the record with an updated customization that has a new default value" +
	"\n\n " +
	"Additional Comments" +
	"\n\n" +
	"1. XML is case-sensitive ('Witness' is not the same as 'witness')" +
	"\n\n" + 
	"2. Quotes around type name can be single or double as long as they match " +
	"(e.g. 'STRING\" is not valid. It must be 'STRING' or \"STRING\")" +
	"\n\n" +
	"3. A Boolean field will be displayed as a checkbox when editing and Yes/No when previewed or printed." +
	"\n\n" +
	"4.  Use \"MESSAGE\" fields to give guidance on how to enter data, and to create comments/notes " +
	"that will be displayed in every record." +
	"\n\n" +
	"5.  Dropdowns using a \"Reusable Choices\" list can have multiple levels " +
	"(e.g. for locations that might have Region and City), different fields can use one or more of the levels, " +
	"and the number of levels is not limited." +
	"\n\n" +
	"6. Both STRING and MULTILINE fields are text fields.  " +
	"STRING fields will expand to fit the size of the text you enter, " +
	"while MULTILINE fields have a scrollbar so that the field doesn't exceed its original height." +
	"\n\n" +
	"7.  A GRID can contain columns of various types:  BOOLEAN, DATE, DATERANGE, DROPDOWN, and STRING. " +
	"When you're entering data into a grid, press Enter to create a new line, press Tab to advance to the next cell, " +
	"and double-click to copy and paste text." +
	"\n\n" +
	"8.  You can update your customization if the information you are collecting over time changes, " +
	"for example by adding new fields.  If you are changing fields in a customization, " +
	"you should think about how you will want to search/report on records created with the old customization " +
	"as well as new records you create with the new customization, " +
	"and try to make the changes so that you can search/report on all records at the same time.  " +
	"Changing field types may cause your searching/reporting to be more complex, " +
	"so we always recommend that you test out creating records with a new customization and searching/reporting " +
	"on both old and new records before officially updating the customization for your project.  " +
	"When you change customizations, Martus will do its best to update the old formatted data to the new customization " +
	"if you create a new version of a record with the old customization.  " +
	"If you add completely new fields but don't change any of the old fields, " +
	"the new version of the record will have all the old fields filled in as they were in the previous version, " +
	"and the new fields will be blank and you can fill them in.  If you delete fields, " +
	"the new version of the record will not contain those fields, but you can go back to see the deleted fields " +
	"in the previous version if it was a sealed record instead of a draft " +
	"(by hitting the Record Details button in the Header section of the record), " +
	"and copy any info from the old version into a different field in the new one if desired.  " +
	"You have to be very careful if you make changes to the customization definitions of old fields.  " +
	"If you keep the same tag and label, but change the type of field, " +
	"Martus may be able to transfer the old data into the new field type, but not in all cases.  " +
	"For example, if you change field type from DROPDOWN to STRING, the data will be transferred over, " +
	"but if you change from STRING to BOOLEAN, the data will be lost. If you change from a DATE to DATERANGE, " +
	"your data will be transferred, but if you change from DATERANGE to DATE, you will lose the end date from your earlier data. " +
	"DROPDOWN and GRID fields are subject to additional rules regarding the modification of dropdown options/values and grid columns. " +
	"If you add options/values to a dropdown list, the old data will be transferred over. " +
	"But if you modify or delete an option/value, all records for which that option was selected will lose that data. " +
	"If you want to add columns to a grid, please make sure to do so at the end of the old grid definition and not in the middle, " +
	"or the old data will not be transferred to the new version of the record. " +
	"If you change fields and lose old data in the new version as a result, " +
	"please note that you can go back to see the deleted data in the previous version " +
	"if it was a sealed record instead of a draft (by hitting the Record Details button in the Header section of the record), " +
	"and copy any info from the old version into a different field in the new one if desired. " +
	"In this release, if you want to change the number of levels in a \"Reusable Choices\" dropdown field when updating a customization, " +
	"you should also change the field tag and/or label so that they are more easily distinguished from each other in searching and reporting.  " +
	"If you do not, the search/report results may be confusing since fields with the same label/tag will be treated differently " +
	"due to them having a different number of levels." +
	"\n\n" +
	"See examples below and if you need additional help with customization, " +
	"please email martus@benetech.org." +
	"\n\n",
"field:CreateCustomFieldsHelp2b= Notes on \"Reusable Choices\" dropdown fields:" +
	"\n\n " +
	"1. Dropdowns using a \"Reusable Choices\" list can have multiple levels (e.g. for locations that might have Region and City), " +
	"different fields can use one or more of the levels (e.g. if you have defined Region and City levels, " +
	"you could have a field that just uses the Region level, and another field that uses both levels), " +
	"and you do not need to define all levels for all entries " +
	"(e.g. you could have defined Neighborhood values as a lower level for some larger Cities, " +
	"but not all Cities need to have Neighborhoods defined).  " +
	"The number of levels is not limited by Martus, but please note that if you have large amounts of data in your definitions lists, " +
	"or a large number of levels, performance of certain Martus record operations may be affected." +
	"\n\n " +
	"2. In this release, we recommend that if you want to change the number of levels in a \"Reusable Choices\" dropdown field " +
	"when updating a customization, you also change the field tag and/or label so that they are more easily distinguished " +
	"from each other in searching and reporting.  If you do not, the search/report results may be confusing since fields " +
	"with the same label/tag will be treated differently due to them having a different number of levels." +
	"\n\n " +
	"3. \"Reusable Choices\" codes have the same restrictions that field tags do; they can be in any language, " +
	"but cannot contain spaces, special characters, or punctuation." +
	"\n\n " +
	"4. Please make sure to not use the same codes in Reusable Choices lists if you edit your customizations " +
	"unless you are just fixing typos in the labels, because using the same code for different labels can cause confusion " +
	"when searching or reporting on those fields. Ideally you should use codes that are not numeric, " +
	"but are letters that are a meaningful abbreviation of the label so there is no confusion over what they stand for " +
	"if you update the customization at a later date (e.g. use 2 or 3 letter abbreviations for locations instead of numbers).  " +
	"See the \"Search\" Help screen for more information about how code and label choices can affect searching on these fields." +
	"\n\n " +
	"5. You cannot use a multiple level / reusable choice dropdown as a data source for another dropdown inside or outside of grids. " +
	"If you try to do this you will see an error message." +
	"\n\n " +
	"6. Please note that when you save customization XML with a Reusable Choices list for dropdown fields, " +
	"Martus will move those choice definitions to the bottom of the XML when you reload it." +

	"Martus searches all versions of every record (both public and private, sealed and draft) in every folder, including the Discarded Records folder.  " +
		"When the search is completed, the Search Results folder lists copies of the records found in your search.\n\n" +
	"You can search for words in any language.  " +
		"Martus searches are not case-sensitive in English and other purely Latin character languages, " +
		"so it doesn't matter whether a word is capitalized or not.\n\n" +
	"Searches include attachment filenames, but not content of attachments.\n\n" +
	"You can search both standard and custom fields.\n\n",
"field:FancySearchHelpMsg2=---Search tips---\n\n" +
	"Martus will find any text you enter whether it's a complete word or part of a larger word. " +
		"For example, if you search for the word prison, you'll see records that include the words prison, imprison, and imprisonment. " +
		"Likewise, if you search for the word prison, " +
		"Martus will find records that include attachments with names such as photos-prison.jpg and prisoners-report.doc.\n\n" + 
	"To search for an exact phrase, type it with quotation marks around the phrase  (e.g.  \"Witness Testimony\"). " +
		"If you do not put quotation marks around the phrase, Martus will search for the words individually.\n\n" + 
	"Use the word \"#Or#\" to broaden your search, or the word \"#And#\" to narrow it.  " +
		"You can use the #And# / #Or# dropdowns to specify different fields you want search across " +
		"(e.g. you want to search for records that have \"Last Saved Date\" in the last week and have a certain author).  " +
		"If you want to search on multiple text values within a single record field, " +
		"you can use #Or# or #And# in-between words in the \"Search For...\" entry box.  " +
		"For example, if you search \"Any Field\" for:\n" +
		"   prison #Or# jail\n" +
		"you'll see a list of records that contain either word anywhere in the record. " + 
		"If you search for:\n" +
		"   prison #And# assault \n" +
		"you'll see a list of records that contain both words. " +
		"The keyword \"#And#\" is implied, so if you search for:\n" +
		"   prison assault \n" +
		"Martus will find the same records as if you searched for:\n" +
		"   prison #And# assault\n\n" + 
	"When you use both \"#And#\" and \"#Or#\", your search terms are grouped from the beginning of your list " +
		"(either across record fields or within a particular field). " +
		"For example, if you enter:\n" +
		"   prison #Or# jail #And# trial \n" +
		"in the \"Search For...\" entry box, " +
		"Martus will search for any records that contain either of the words prison or jail, and also contain the word trial. " +   
		"But if you enter:\n" +
		"   prison #And# jail #Or# trial \n" +
		"Martus will search for any records that contain both the words prison and jail, or contain the word trial.\n",
"field:FancySearchHelpMsg3=" + 
	"You can use the word #Or# or #And#, or you can use the English words \"#OrEnglish#\" and \"#AndEnglish#\" to search.\n\n" +  
	"You need to put spaces before and after any #Or# / #And# keywords you use in your search.\n",
"field:FancySearchHelpMsg4="
+ "If you want all of your multi-item list search criteria to be met in a single list item, "
+ "please check the \"Match multi-item list details\" checkbox. For example, "
+ "if you want to search for a specific victim name in a single item in your records created after a certain date, "
+ "select the checkbox and enter the following fields in the Search screen: \"Victim Information: First Name\" = x and "
+ "\"Victim Information: Last Name\" = y and \"Date Created\" >= YYYY-Mon-DD. "
+ "If you do not select the \"Match multi-item list details\" checkbox, "
+ "Martus will find records created after your specified date where any item has the first name you specified and any other item has the last name specified, "
+ "but not necessarily in the same item (you could have an item with \"First Name\" = x and \"Last Name\" = b, "
+ "and a different item with \"First Name\" = a and \"Last Name\" = y, "
+ "and Martus will find that record as matching the search because you did not specify that it had to match in a single item)\n\n",
"field:FancySearchHelpMsg5= Additional Search Notes:\n\n"
+ " 1. Because Martus searches all details of any multi-item list for your criteria, "
+ "it may find records where one item detail matches your criteria but other details do not. "
+ "For example you could have a record with an item that has a location field in it and you have "
+ "multiple details in the item with locations A, B, and C. "
+ "If you search for records where location != C (does not equal C), "
+ "Martus will find that record because there are 2 details in the record item where the location is not C, "
+ "even though there is one item where the locations IS C."
+ "\n\n"
+ " 2. In this release, if you are searching on a multi-level dropdown, "
+ "all searches are exact matches, not partial or \"starts with\" matches. "
+ "This means that you have to pick the exact level at which you want to be searching. "
+ "For example, an \"Event Location\" field that has three levels (Region/City/Neighborhood) "
+ "will have three entries in the search field list: Event Location: Region, "
+ "Event Location: City, and Event Location: Neighborhood. "
+ "So if you want to find any records that have an Event Location anywhere in Region X "
+ "(regardless of the City), you have to pick the \"Event Location: Region\" "
+ "field to search on and pick Region X off the dropdown list choices. "
+ "If you pick Event Location: City to search on and then pick Region X but leave the City level blank, "
+ "Martus will only find entries where there was no City data entered (City was blank), "
+ "as opposed to ANY location with Region X regardless of what data was entered at the City level."
+ "\n\n"
+ " 3. If you do not see your search terms/dates in the final version of the record displayed in the Search Results folder, "
+ "your criteria may have been matched in an earlier version of the record. "
+ "You can access previous versions by clicking the \"Record Details\" button at the bottom of the record. "
+ "To search only the most recent versions of records, select \"Only search most recent version of records\" in the Search dialog box."
+ "\n\n"
+ " 4. If you have fields in different records or from different customizations that are exactly the same, "
+ "Martus will combine them in any Search and Report field lists. "
+ "And while Martus warns you about duplicate labels when you are creating a new record customization, "
+ "it is possible that over time, you may have records with different customizations that ended up with the same labels "
+ "(e.g. maybe you changed a text field to a dropdown field but kept the same label). "
+ "In these cases, Martus will display both fields in the search screen, "
+ "and try to help you figure out the difference between the fields by displaying what the field type and tag are in the field selection lists. "
+ "Also, if you have fields with the same tag but different labels and/or field types, "
+ "Martus may use the tag and field type to try and determine when different fields were meant to be the same. "
+ "So we encourage you to make your field tags and labels in a customization clearly related to each other to avoid any confusion."
+ "\n\n"
+ " 5. You may sometimes see duplicate entries in dropdown list search criteria values in the search screen. "
+ "If you pick a Reusable Choices dropdown field to search on, "
+ "the values that are displayed as the criteria dropdown list options are the labels for each list entry, "
+ "but the codes you defined determine how many entries there will be in the search dropdown list. "
+ "So if you have different Reusable Choices codes with the same label in different record customizations in your account, "
+ "the labels will show up twice in search dropdown lists "
+ "(i.e. if you used label1 for both code1 and code2, "
+ "you will see 2 entries in the search dropdown that looks like \"label1\" and your search will be on records that have that label, "
+ "regardless of which code the customization had for the label). "
+ "And if you have the same Reusable Choices code with different labels in different record customizations in your account, "
+ "the search dropdown list for that code will show both values separated by a semicolon "
+ "(i.e. if you used code1 for both label1 and label2, you will see an entry in the search dropdown that looks like \"label1; label2\" "
+ "and your search will be on records that have either of those labels)."
